# ncov-utils
Utility scripts and modules written in R and Python for processing ncov19 samples using the ivar pipeline. 

Workflow tasks addressed through these modules include multi-FASTA header renaming for data submission,
the automation of phylogenetic tree annotation, surveillance reporting for
COVID-19 variants of concern (VoC), and assessing the quality of variant calling sites. Most scripts are
intended to be optimized using bash scripts for ease of use with command-line interface (CLI).
