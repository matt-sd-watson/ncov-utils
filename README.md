# ncov-utils
Utility scripts and modules written in R and Python for processing ncov19 samples using the ivar pipeline. 

Workflow tasks addressed through these modules include: 
- multi-FASTA header renaming for data submission
- the automation of phylogenetic tree annotation
- surveillance reporting for COVID-19 variants of concern (VoC)
- assessing the quality of variant calling sites
- parsing variant report outputs from ivar
- Containerization and workflow management for ncov pipelines

Most scripts are intended to be optimized using bash scripts for ease of use with command-line interface (CLI).
